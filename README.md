# UMich-EECS-498-007-598-005 Solutions
My personal solutions to the assignments of the online course "UMich EECS 498-007 / 598-005: Deep Learning for Computer Vision."

## Installation and Environment

This repository is designed to run in a local environment with the following dependencies:
	-	Python 3.12.3
	-	PyTorch 2.5.1
	-	CUDA 12.4 (for GPU acceleration)
	-	Jupyter Notebook
 
## A1 - PyTorch101 and KNN
	-	Focuses on introducing PyTorch and implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
	-	**Modifications**: The original assignment included Google Colab instructions. I have adapted all code to run locally in Jupyter Notebook for better compatibility and performance.
